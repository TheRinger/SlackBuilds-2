## SlackBuilds script for NVIDIA CUDA version 10.1.168

The NVIDIA® CUDA® Toolkit provides a development environment for creating high
performance GPU-accelerated applications. With the CUDA Toolkit, you can
develop, optimize and deploy your applications on GPU-accelerated embedded
systems, desktop workstations, enterprise data centers, cloud-based platforms
and HPC supercomputers. The toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries,
debugging and optimization tools, a C/C++ compiler and a runtime library to
deploy your application.

If the link from the cudatoolkit.info is not working for downloading the
source, the file can be downloaded from
<https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>

The necessary file to download is under the following specifications:
Operating System: Linux
Architecture: x86_64
Distribution: RHEL
Version: 7
Installer Type: runfile (local)

The runfile is 2.4 GiB and the temporary extracted size required is 4.2 GiB.
The compressed package will take around 2.2 GiB.

This is not an official SlackBuild and has not been tested with the NVIDIA
driver and kernel module available from SlackBuilds.org. We use /tmp/SBo as the
default temporary directory but the build tag is "custom". This version of CUDA
has been tested with driver and kernel module version 430.34 and was found to
work correctly.
